Small, complete command-line projects in pure Python. **Standard library only —
zero pip installs, zero venv setup.** Each one is real enough to be useful and
small enough to read in one sitting. Learning in public, done properly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer (`python3 --version`)
- that's the whole list

## Projects

| project | what it does | try it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [passgen](passgen/) | password generator with entropy scoring | `python3 passgen/passgen.py -l 24 -v` |
| [todo-cli](todo-cli/) | json-backed todo list with stats | `python3 todo-cli/todo.py add "ship it"` |
| [weather-cli](weather-cli/) | current conditions via wttr.in | `python3 weather-cli/weather.py pune` |
| [disk-audit](disk-audit/) | find what's eating your disk | `python3 disk-audit/audit.py ~/Downloads` |
| [netcheck](netcheck/) | port / dns / http diagnostics | `python3 netcheck/netcheck.py port example.com 443` |
| [serveit](serveit/) | static file server, one command | `python3 serveit/serveit.py ~/share` |

Every project has tests. Every project has a README that fits on one screen.

## Running the tests

```bash
make test        # all six suites
# or individually:
python3 -m unittest discover -s passgen
python3 -m unittest discover -s todo-cli
python3 -m unittest discover -s weather-cli
python3 -m unittest discover -s disk-audit
python3 -m unittest discover -s netcheck
python3 -m unittest discover -s serveit
```

CI runs the same suites on Python 3.9 through 3.12 on every push.

## House rules

- **stdlib only.** If it needs `pip`, it doesn't belong here.
- **every project ships with tests that pass** — enforced by CI.
- **readmes tell the truth.** No roadmap theater, no feature fiction.
- **small is the point.** Each project is one file of logic plus its tests.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Keep it dependency-free, keep it tested, keep it honest.

## License

MIT (see [LICENSE](LICENSE))

## Versioning

no releases — `main` is always green (CI enforces it) and every project is invocable straight from a clone. if that ever changes, this file will say so loudly.
